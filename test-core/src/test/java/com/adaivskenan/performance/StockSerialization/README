To build:
    Even if you are not using an entity manager, building this requires a
    JPA implementation (since the mock entity manager still uses JPA
    interfaces). Download an implementation (e.g., the reference implementation
    from GlassFish) and in your environment set

    JAVAX_PERSISTENCE=path_to/javax.persistence.jar

    Then run
    ant

To run:
    java <jvmargs> -DMockEntityManager=MockEntityManager \
          -jar jars/StockSerialization.jar 

Notes on Examples:
Example 10-11:
    The regular SPH is labeled eager transient in the output
    The transient histogram is labeled eagaer transient

Example 10-12:
    No compresion is the regular SPH case
    Compression/Decompression is the serialize/deserialize case
    Compression only is the lazy compression case

Example 12-1:
    Unbuffered compression/decompression output
