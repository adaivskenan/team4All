To build:
    ant

To run:
    java <jvmargs> -jar jars/classloading.jar jarfile nThreads useLargeStack

    jarfile -- All classes from this jar file will be loaded in the customer
        class loader
    nThreads -- Number of threads to execute simultaneously
    useLargeStack -- If true, then the lookup will be performed from a
        call stack of 40 entries

    In general, the examples leverage the modules from glassfish, but any
    large set of jar files and classes can be used.

Notes on Examples:

Example 12-2
    java -jar jars/classloading.jar /path_to/guava.jar N false
    where N varies from 1 to 8

Example 12-3
    java -jar jars/classloading.jar /path_to/guava.jar N false
    where N varies from 1 to 8
    and where the CLASSPATH contains all jar files from glassfish
    (266 entries)
