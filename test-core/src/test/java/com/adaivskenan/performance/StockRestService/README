To build:
    Building this requires a JavaEE application server that supplies
    servlet, JPA, and EJB interfaces.
    You must set the following environment variables:
    JAVAX_PERSISTENCE=/path_to/javax.persistence.jar
    JAVAX_RS=/path_to/javax.ws.rs-api.jar
    JSON_P=/path_to/javax.json.jar

To deploy:
    Set up and configure a JavaEE application server. Even if you
    intend only to use the mock entity manager, the application server must
    define a JDBC data source with the name StockDB.

    Deploy to any JavaEE application server.  For a simple deployment with
    glassfish, copy the jars/StockEar.ear to the glassfish domain's
    autodeploy directory.

    If you want to use the mock entity manager, configure the app server
    to use
    -DMockEntityManager=MockEntityManager
    as one of its JVM parameters (along with whatever parameters you are
    interested in testing)

    You must have a REST client to test this with. One simple way to
    do that is to use NetBean to generate a dummy Rest Client to access
    the service.

    For load testing, fhb cannot generate the required tests, but a faban
    driver (used for the examples) is found in StockRestDriver. Or utilize
    any load generator to generate rest calls to
    http://localhost:8080/StockPriceRestService/webresources/StockPrice?mode=1&startDate=01%2F01%2F2013&endDate=12%2F31%2F2017&cache=true&symbol=<SYMBOL>
