To build:
    Building this requires the Faban driver kit downloaded from
    http://faban.org
    You must set the following environment variable:
    FABAN_DRIVER=/path_to/fabandriver.jar

To run:
    Edit the run.xml file and change the
    outputDir -- Where you want the output saved
    HOST -- server where the service is deployed
    POST -- port where the service is deployed
    In the operationMix, set the test you want to execute to 1
    and set all other tests to 0 (or, alternately, set those values
    to execute a mix of operations)

    Set your clsaspath to incude fabancommon.jar, fabandriver.jar, and
    jars/driver.jar
    java -Dbenchmark.config=run.xml com.sun.faban.driver.engine.MasterImpl

    The output directory will have a set of numbered directories (starting at
    1, increasing monotonically for each run). The summary.xml file in each
    directory will have the repsonse times and so on.

Example 10-14 and 10-15:
    The various scenarios are chosen by setting the operationMix as described
    above.

    The caching in scenario 15 is enabled by setting the CACHE property
    to true in the run.xml file.
