To build:
    Even if you are not using an entity manager, building this requires a
    JPA implementation (since the mock entity manager still uses JPA
    interfaces). Download an implementation (e.g., the reference implementation
    from GlassFish) and in your environment set

    JAVAX_PERSISTENCE=path_to/javax.persistence.jar

    Then run
    ant

To run:
    In general, to use a MockEntityManager, run

    java <jvmargs> -DMockEntityManager=MockEntityManager \
        -jar jars/StockBatchingForkJoin.jar \
	[size_of_fork/join_pool]

    The fork/join pool size is optional and defaults to the number of CPUs
    on the machine. Remember that the operation will also use the calling
    thread, so the effective number of tasks running simultaneously is one
    more than the pool size.
