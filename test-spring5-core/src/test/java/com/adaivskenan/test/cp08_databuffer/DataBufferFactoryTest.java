 *         to flip() to alternate between read and write.
 * 
 *         Capacity expanded on demand as with java.lang.StringBuilder.
 * 
 *         Pooled buffers and reference counting via PooledDataBuffer.
 * 
 *         View a buffer as java.nio.ByteBuffer, InputStream, or OutputStream.
 * 
 *         Determine the index, or the last index, for a given byte.
