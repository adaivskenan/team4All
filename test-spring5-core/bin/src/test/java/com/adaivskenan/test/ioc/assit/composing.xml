	<!-- It is possible, but not recommended, to reference files in parent directories 
		using a relative "../" path. Doing so creates a dependency on a file that 
		is outside the current application. In particular, this reference is not 
		recommended for classpath: URLs (for example, classpath:../services.xml), 
		where the runtime resolution process chooses the “nearest” classpath root 
		and then looks into its parent directory. Classpath configuration changes 
		may lead to the choice of a different, incorrect directory. -->
